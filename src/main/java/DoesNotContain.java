     * through this problem with pencil and paper in plain English before attempting it in code.
     * For instance: for the contains problem, your code had to check every value to see if the value
     * matches the target, and if it matched the target, the array was sure to contain the target. Think
     * of a similar process here.
     *
     * @param arr the array we will be manipulating.
     * @param target the value we are searching for.
     * @return true if arr does not contain target. false otherwise.
